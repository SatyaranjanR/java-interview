**Basic Concepts**

1.	**What is Spring Boot, and why is it preferred for Microservices? **

Spring Boot accelerates the development of microservices by providing a ready-to-use framework with minimal configuration, embedded servers, and seamless integration with other Spring Cloud tools for managing distributed systems. This combination of simplicity, flexibility, and scalability makes it a popular choice for microservices architectures.

2.	**Explain the differences between **Monolithic** and **Microservices** architectures.**

*In conclusion*, Monolithic Architecture is simpler and often better suited for smaller applications or when a project is in its early stages. Microservices Architecture, on the other hand, is more complex but offers advantages in terms of scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, especially as applications grow and evolve.


3.	**What are the key features of Spring Boot that support Microservices development?**
      
Spring Boot provides a host of features that support microservice development, such as embedded servers, auto-configuration, seamless integration with Spring Cloud, easy creation of RESTful APIs, security, and fault tolerance. These features make it easier to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than infrastructure and configuration.

4.	**What is a **Spring Boot starter**? Name a few commonly used starters in Microservices.**

•	spring-boot-starter-web: For building RESTful APIs.

•	 spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: For database interaction with JPA.

•	spring-boot-starter-amqp: For messaging systems (e.g., RabbitMQ).

•	 spring-boot-starter-security: For adding security and authentication mechanisms.

•	spring-boot-starter-cloud-config: For centralized configuration management in microservices.

•	 spring-boot-starter-actuator: For monitoring, metrics, and health checks.

•	spring-boot-starter-logging: For logging configurations.

•	spring-boot-starter-hystrix: For fault tolerance using circuit breakers.

5. **Explain the **Twelve-Factor App** methodology and its relevance to Microservices.**
